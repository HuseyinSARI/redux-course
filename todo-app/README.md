# Todo app with redux via thunk

 I learned to make async requests on the server with redux-thunk in this project.

### Installation
Install required dependencies on both server and client side with `npm install`

Go to *server folder* and run `npm run dev` command. In this way, both the server and the client part will stand up.

You can see the app at `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
